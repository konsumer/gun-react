# Gun + React

This is a demo of modern usage of [gun](https://gun.eco/) and react.

I am also using [tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [daisyui](https://daisyui.com/), but these are totally optional, and just make it faster to style.

This is intentionally very simple, and just sets up a context for gun-object.

## try it out

```sh
npm i
npm start
```
